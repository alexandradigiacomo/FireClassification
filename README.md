# FireClassification
This repository contains the scripts to compute forest burn area from UAS imagery. This project is carried out as part of an effort by the Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) in the Marine Robotics and Remote Sensing Laboratory of Duke University. The 'FireClassification.py' script can be uploaded to ArcGIS to create a user-friendly tool. 

This tool takes, as an input, an orthomosaic and a Digital Surface Model (DSM). These products are derived from processing of Unoccupied Aircraft System (UAS) imagery in Structure-from-Motion softwares like Pix4D or Agisoft Metashape. Additionally, this tool takes, as an input, manually identified ground points. The GUI prompts the user to identify 10-30 ground points using the orthomosaic. As a result, this tool outputs a binary classification raster distinguishing burned area from non-burned area by (1) filtering out low-lying vegetation in the DSM using the elevations of manually-identified ground points and (2) masking out low vegetation in the corresponding orthomosaic and computing relationships between optical indices.
