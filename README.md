# FireClassification
This repository contains the scripts to compute forest burn area from UAS imagery. This project is carried out as part of an effort by the Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) in the Marine Robotics and Remote Sensing Laboratory of Duke University. 

The orthomosaic rasters used to perform these analysis were uploaded to Duke Box due to github file size limitations. Fire Surveys (1 and 2): https://duke.app.box.com/folder/113625452147

This tool takes, as an input, an orthomosaic and Digital Surface Model (DSM). These products are derived from processing of Unoccupied Aircraft System (UAS) imagery in Structure-from-Motion softwares like Pix4D or Agisoft Metashape. This tool outputs
